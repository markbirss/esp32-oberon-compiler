# Bare metal assembly language trial

This code has been used to verify the comprehension of the author on the working conditions required to get an independant development framework useable on an ESP32.

Beyond the use of the assembler, linker and uploader, there is no usage of any other code/library/tools from the ESP-IDF framework.
