# ESP32 Oberon-07 Compiler

This is an ongoing effort to build an ESP32 Oberon Compiler, using the Oberon-07 Compiler from [Project Oberon](http://www.projectoberon.com) by Niklaus Wirth and JÃ¼rg Gutknecht and some code from project [Oberon Extended](https://github.com/andreaspirklbauer/Oberon-extended) by Mr. Andreas Pirklbauer. Test cases are being designed in part using the [OberonC](https://github.com/lboasso) effort by Luca Boasso.

The code is being ported to [OBNC](https://miasap.se/obnc/) and produces ELF object code through ESP32 assembly language generation. 

Up to 2020.03.31, I was targeting a 'bare metal' version, supplying everything necessary for building applications, relying only on the assembler linker and loader provided with [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/). 

I'm now migrating the compiler to supply the capability of interfacing with the ESP-IDF. Two main reasons for this are:

- Some aspects of the ESP32 architecture are being kept unaccessible to third parties developpers. This is the case for the WiFi subsystem that is a mandatory use, at least, for me...; and
- The richness of hardware interfaces available with the ESP32 would require a lot of recoding in the Oberon language. It is then beneficial to get access to components already available with the ESP-IDF framework.

My ToDo document has been modified to reflect this new orientation.

This is the intent. A large portion of the compiler is in a workable condition at this point in time.

The folder `test-baremetal` demonstrates the feasibility of independent coding from ESP-IDF. It is a working piece of assembly code that I made that can be compiled and pushed to an ESP32. It gets a led blink every half a second and pushes some message on the serial port. This was the starting point to start modeling an executable architecture based on the ESP32 for Oberon.

## Installation

### OBNC

The OBNC Oberon-07 version 0.16.1 is used to build this compiler. The author is using it on both Linux and MacOs platforms without any major issue (Except for the SYSTEM.VAL() that needed to be replaced). It must be built using the following commands and option (after having changed current folder to OBNC):

```sh
$ ./build --c-real-type=float
$ ./install
```

(Both INTEGER and REAL must be set to 32bits. The compiler is verifying this aspect on startup.)

The OBNC Oberon-07 compiler is required with the extension libraries to parse command line arguments. Both are available from [this](https://miasap.se/obnc/) location.

### ESP-IDF

The ESP-IDF development framework must be present and setup in the user environment. Please follow the [receipe](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html#setting-up-development-environment), up to and including step 4.

### ESP32 Oberon Compiler and run-time

For now, there is a simple Makefile in the main folder that will automate the creation of the Oberon compiler executable. To build, simply use the command `make` to compile it. The result will be the executable file named `Oberon` in the main folder.

The runtime environment is located in the `lib/` sub-folder. It must also be built after the compiler. Simply change current folder to `lib/` and then use the command `make`.

You can then create your own program. The folder `Test` and `Trial` contains two programs with appropriate makefiles to automate the built and the transmission of the application to a connected ESP32 board through USB. The `Makefile` present in these folders would give some lignts on how to organise your own program.

As stated, this is still under eavy development and is regularly being updated (like several times a day). There is still some bugs presents and many modules to control the ESP32 hardware interfaces remains to be added.

The `compiler-test-suite/` is currently being constructed and is still not ready. The aim is to get all the programs there to be compiled and run in sequence on an ESP32 board. When completed, I would then declare the compiler ready...
