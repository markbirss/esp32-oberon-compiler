# esp32-oberon-compiler

This is an ongoing effort to build an ESP32 Oberon Compiler, using the Oberon-07 Compiler from http://www.projectoberon.com by Niklaus Wirth. 

The code is being ported to obnc and will generate ELF compatible object code to be used with the ESP-IDF framework.

At least, this is the intent. Nothing is in a workable condition at this point in time.
